Subject: [PATCH 12/13] mcvevk: fix device tree to work with DM serial

Device trees need to have the serial console device available
before relocation and require a stdout-path in chosen at least
for SPL to have a console. This has been done for the other
socfpga boards by commit 79a436d56848c4213c1452ca60211568b0c8b31a.
