Subject: [PATCH 10/10] drm/panel: increase clock freq of Ampire AM-800480R2 to
 get 60 Hz vrefresh

Commit 0425662fdf05665235e768e2fbcb4ced12432b43 nukes the mode->vrefresh
and just calculate it on demand. Unfortunately, the calculated frequency
for the Ampire AM-800480R2 is just 56 instead of 60 Hz, which shifts the
beginnig of the line beyond the middle of the display. To compensate for
that, we increase the clock frequency.
